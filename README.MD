Termux-upload script collection
===

Since there's no ShareX/Screencloud or any other similar software for android, I wrote a few shell scripts to be used with termux to recreate at least some of the uploading functionality. Please note that I wrote this for my personal use (Linx+YOURLS), and a lot of modification will be needed if you end up using this for your own setup, but at least it's a good place to start. These scripts require [termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux), [termux-api](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux.api). After installing both run `pkg update && pkg install termux-api curl jq` and you should be ready go.

# Installation instructions
If entering them by hand on a phone or tablet, I recommend using [Hacker's Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard/) which has arrow keys and a tab button for autocomplete.

```bash
$ pkg update
$ pkg install wget # termux come with busybox wget by default that doesn't support https
$ hash -r
$ wget https://github.com/zingmars/termux-scripts/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ pkg install vim #or nano or whatever editor you want
$ cd termux-scripts-master
$ chmod +x *.sh
# ! Edit your files, i.e. vim upload.sh
$ pkg install termux-api curl jq
# Install the scripts
$ cd $HOME && mkdir bin && ln -s $HOME/termux-scripts-master/upload.sh $HOME/bin/termux-file-editor
$ ln -s $HOME/termux-scripts-master/delete.sh /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/delete-file
$ ln -s $HOME/termux-scripts-master/shorten.sh /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/shorten
```

# Script descriptions
## upload.sh

Simple upload script. Edit it's curl upload commands. Afterwards place it in termux's `$HOME/bin/` rename it to termux-file-editor (or just symlink it) and then share your files to Termux like you would to any other app. A bit hackish, but it works. 

## delete.sh

Sends a DELETE request to an URL either passed as a parameter or from a file generated by upload.sh. Might not be needed for your host.

## shorten.sh

Shortens the passed URL. Uses a private YOURLS instance by default.
