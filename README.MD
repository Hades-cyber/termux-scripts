Termux-upload script collection
===

Since there's no ShareX/Screencloud or any other similar software for android, I wrote a few shell scripts to be used with termux to recreate at least some of the uploading functionality. Please note that I wrote this for my personal use (Linx+YOURLS), and a lot of modification will be needed if you end up using this for your own setup, but at least it's a good place to start. These scripts require [termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux), [termux-api](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux.api). After installing both run `apt update && apt upgrade && apt install termux-api curl jq` and you should be ready go.

## upload.sh

Simple upload script. Edit it's curl upload commands. Afterwards place it in termux's `$HOME/bin/` rename it to termux-file-editor and then share your files to Termux like you would to any other app. A bit hackish, but it works. 

## delete.sh

Sends a DELETE request to an URL either passed as a parameter or from a file generated by upload.sh. Might not be needed for your host.

## shorten.sh

Shortens the passed URL. Uses a private YOURLS instance by default.
